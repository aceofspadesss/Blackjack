Blackjack for web browsers (written in HTML, CSS, SASS, JS and jQuery).

Download this repo and open index.html to start playing.

To do list (Just some tasks I am going to do to improve the project):

- Rewrite the project in React JS.
- Add screen for making bets in the game itself instead of switching to a different one.
- Make the project responsive for all screen resolutions.
